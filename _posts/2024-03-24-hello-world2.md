# Welcome 2

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post. This is the very first post created with Jekyll & GitHub Pages

Take a look at my cat:

![cat]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cat.jpg)

![cat](dev-blog/assets/cat.jpg) 

Project relative, same branch:
![cat](/assets/cat.jpg) 

Another branch, always main:
![cat](/../main/assets/cat.jpg?raw=true)

Main branch using blob URL:

![cat](../blob/main/assets/cat.jpg?raw=true)

Full RAW URL:

![cat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedleszczynski/dev-blog/main/assets/cat.jpg)





Also looks a this [sample.txt](dev-blog//assets/sample.txt) downloadable text file

... you can [get the PDF](/assets/sample.txt) directly.
